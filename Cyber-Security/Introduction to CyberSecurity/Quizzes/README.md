- [ ] to obtain all addresses in the address book within the server
- [ ] to scan the data on the target server
<b>Explanation:</b> A denial of service (DoS) attack attempts to overwhelm a system or process by sending large amounts of data or requests to the target. The goal is to keep the system so overwhelmed handling false requests that it is unable to respond to legitimate ones.

### 6. What is the purpose of a rootkit?
- [ ] to replicate itself independently of any other programs
- [x] to gain privileged access to a device while concealing itself
- [ ] to deliver advertisements without user consent

‚Äì Rootkit (gains privileged access to a machine while concealing itself)			 
‚Äì Spyware (collects information from a target system)						 
‚Äì Adware (delivers advertisements with or without consent)					 
‚Äì Bot (waits for commands from the hacker)							 
‚Äì Ransomware (holds a computer system or data captive until payment is received)ent)


### 7. Which example illustrates how malware might be concealed?

<b>Explanation:</b> An email attachment that appears as valid software but actually contains spyware shows how malware might be concealed. An attack to block access to a website is a DoS attack. A hacker uses search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning to improve the ranking of a website so that users are directed to a malicious site that hosts malware or uses social engineering methods to obtain information. A botnet of zombie computers is used to launch a DDoS attack.

 ### 8. What is the most common goal of search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning?
- [ ] to trick someone into installing malware or divulging personal information
- [ ] to build a botnet of zombies
- [ ] to overwhelm a network device with maliciously formed packets
