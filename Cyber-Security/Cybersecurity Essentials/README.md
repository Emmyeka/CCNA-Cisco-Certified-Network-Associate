## üîπ Charpter 1 ‚Äì Ethics Quiz

							
### 1. An employee is at a restaurant with friends and describes an exciting new video game that is under development at the company the employee works for. Is the behavior of the employee ethical or unethical?
 
   - [ ] ethical
   - [x] unethical

<b>Explanation:</b>It is not ethical to share a confidential product idea before it is released. Describing the game to a group of friends outside the company could leak the idea and jeopardize the new product offering.

### 2. During a meeting with the Marketing department, a representative from IT discusses features of an upcoming product that will be released next year.


   - [ ] ethical
   - [x] unethical

<b>Explanation:</b> Sharing information on a new product to the Marketing department of the same company is ethical behavior. It gives them ample lead time to begin development of a marketing plan for the new product.

### 3. An employee points out a design flaw in a new product to the department manager.
- [ ] unethical	
- [x] ethical

<b>Explanation:</b>Both the employee and the manager are within the same department and company so this behavior would be ethical.

   - [ ] ethical
   - [x] unethical
   
<b>Explanation:</b>										 Employees should never give their credentials to another employee, regardless of the situation or the familiarity with the other employee. Once your credentials are out of your sight, you have no idea what they are being used for.


### 5. An employee is laid off after fifteen years with the same company. The employee is then hired by another company within a week. In the new company, the employee shares documents and ideas for products that the employee proposed at the original company.

   - [ ] ethical
   - [x] unethical

<b>Explanation:</b>											 Even though the employee was laid off, the employee probably signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with the original company. Any work or idea developed at the original company, regardless of who proposed the idea, is still the property of the original company. Depending on the level of severity of the breach, this could result in legal action.
