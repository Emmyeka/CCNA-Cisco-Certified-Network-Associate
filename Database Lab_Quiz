create table student (id int (10) not null, name varchar(10) not null, email varchar(50), primary key(id) ) ;

create table course (code varchar (10) not null, title varchar (20) not null, credit int (10), 
primary key(code) ) ;

create table result (id int (10) not null, code varchar(10) not null, gpa double, 
primary key(id,code)) ;


insert into student values (1, "shafayet", "shafayet@gmail.com"), (2, "jobaer", "jobaer@gmail.com"),
(3, "rahim", "rahim@gmail.com"),(4, "karim", "karim@gmail.com");

insert into course values (‘cse1011’, ‘c’, 3),(‘cse3012’, "c lab", 3),(‘cse3011, ‘database’, 3), (‘cse3012, ‘database lab’, 1),

insert into result values ( 1,’cse1011’,3.5), (2,’cse1012’, 3),(3,’cse3011’, 4),(4,’cse3012’, 3.8);
